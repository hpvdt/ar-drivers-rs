# Dummy AR Glasses Integration Fixture

The dummy AR glasses fixture is a deterministic, public, configurable simulator that remains the fallback used by
`any_glasses_or_dummy()`. It is implemented in @dummy.rs

## Public API

- Expose the fixture through `pub mod sim` and re-export `Dummy`, `DummyConfig`, and `DummySnapshot`.
- Provide `Dummy::new()`, `Dummy::with_seed(u64)`, `Dummy::with_config(DummyConfig)`, `Default`, `snapshot()`, and
    `accelerometer_reading()`.
- Keep default operation deterministic and virtual-time based, with the first emitted event being `AccGyro`.
- Pace `read_event` to the configured event period in wall time: sleep for the period minus the wall time elapsed since
  the previous event, clamped to zero. Virtual periods longer than 20 ms cannot be represented this way, so those
  events are emitted immediately.

## Sensor Model

- Emit `AccGyro` and `Magnetometer` events strictly alternating from a 9-axis simulated AR glasses stream.
- Keep all emitted sensor vectors in the native `GlassesEvent` RUB body frame.
- Start level with magnetic north as forward, which is negative Z in RUB.
- Keep the glasses rotating on all three angular axes with deterministic random nonnegative body rates, each nonzero and
  no faster than the configurable per-axis bound, which defaults to 20 RPM so ideal magnetometer changes are not
  dominated by the default sample noise.
- Track full linear kinematics internally: position, velocity, acceleration, jerk, and attitude.
- Update smooth linear movement by sampling Gaussian jerk, integrating it into acceleration, velocity, and position, and
  applying damping/clamps to keep the simulation bounded.

## Noise And Distortion

- Gyro emits RUB angular body rates in rad/s with small Gaussian noise.
- Acc emits physical gravity plus linear acceleration in RUB with medium Gaussian noise.
- Mag emits magnetic north in RUB with magnetic dip clamped to +/-30 degrees.
- Clamp each distorted and noisy magnetometer component to a configurable symmetric physical range in microtesla.
- Inject hard-iron and soft-iron distortion into magnetometer readings. Keep the default hard-iron offset stationary for
  static calibration, and provide `DummyConfig::adaptive_calibration_stress()` as the explicit deterministic profile
  with `(2.0, 1.5, 2.5)` microtesla drift amplitudes over a five-minute cycle.
- Keep the randomly generated soft-iron matrix fixed for the lifetime of the fixture.
- Keep the default hard-iron bias below 50 microtesla while still giving integration tests a realistic calibration
  challenge.
- Expose lower and upper bounds for each soft-iron eigenvalue through `DummyConfig` as `soft_iron_min_eigenvalue` and
  `soft_iron_max_eigenvalue`.
- Compute the permanent vector-norm bounds `sqrt(soft_iron_min_eigenvalue)` and `sqrt(soft_iron_max_eigenvalue)` once
  during fixture initialization.
- Generate three seeded random vectors and apply Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization without normalizing them. After
  orthogonalization, clamp each vector's L2 norm to the permanent vector-norm bounds so the scale remains baked into the
  vector. Resample a vector if it is degenerate or too close to the span of the preceding vectors.
- Form a matrix `V` from the three mutually orthogonal, scaled vectors and construct the soft-iron matrix as
  `S = V V^T`. The normalized directions of the vectors are the eigenvectors of `S`, and its eigenvalues are their
  squared L2 norms, so `S` is symmetric positive definite and every eigenvalue remains within the configured bounds
  without SVD validation.
- Generate `S` once during fixture initialization and reuse it for every magnetometer reading.

## Non-Sensor Behavior

- Persist display mode through `set_display_mode` / `get_display_mode`.
- Keep the existing dummy FOV and display delay.
- Return an identity IMU-to-display transform instead of panicking.
